Maine, 1789: When the Kennebec River freezes, entombing a man in the ice, Martha Ballard is summoned to examine the body and determine cause of death. As a midwife and healer, she is privy to much of what goes on behind closed doors in Hallowell. Her diary is a record of every birth and death, crime and debacle that unfolds in the close-knit community. Months earlier, Martha documented the details of an alleged rape committed by two of the town’s most respected gentlemen—one of whom has now been found dead in the ice. But when a local physician undermines her conclusion, declaring the death to be an accident, Martha is forced to investigate the shocking murder on her own.. Over the course of one winter, as the trial nears, and whispers and prejudices mount, Martha doggedly pursues the truth. Her diary soon lands at the center of the scandal, implicating those she loves, and compelling Martha to decide where her own loyalties lie.. Clever, layered, and subversive, Ariel Lawhon’s newest offering introduces an unsung heroine who refused to accept anything less than justice at a time when women were considered best seen and not heard. The Frozen River is a thrilling, tense, and tender story about a remarkable woman who left an unparalleled legacy yet remains nearly forgotten to this day.",

The titular frozen river itself is so prominent as to be a character in its own right. Animals, both wild and domestic, are integral.As historical fiction, this is really top notch, set on the foundation of extensive research. As a mystery, it’s equally fine. To have both in one volume is a multitude of riches. It feels like a book with the depth and intensity of 600+ pages. (It doesn’t feel like a long book - it’s such a page-turner that it feels relatively short.) The main characters are intricately drawn; the lesser characters are essential to crafting the plot.I had thought I wouldn’t be especially interested in a midwife’s story but I was hooked from the very beginning. Be warned that there’s the gore of birth itself, plus the explicit violence of rape and murder. This is also a courtroom drama, dramatic partly because the fledgling justice system is unfamiliar to modern readers.I can’t recommend this highly enough. I was riveted."

Martha is loved by many and hated by some.  She seems to have her fingers in all kinds of things.  This book is loosely based on Martha Ballard's life.  The writing is wonderful and it is like sitting down with an old friend over tea.I learned so much about midwives.  I loved that her husband both listened to her but also trusted her and embraced her knowledge.I hated how she was treated, and all woman, by men in that time.  It frustrated me and made me angry.This is a great read, so yourself a favor and give it a go."

I removed the case from my pillow and within 1 hour my allergy symptoms were gone. I had to toss both pillow cases. I think these are made somewhere where there is something I am allergic to. I just wanted to give people a heads up about this. It’s something that doesn’t happen very often, but sometimes allergies are an issue. I don’t think it’s Amazon’s issue. I am pretty sure the problem is where they are made or a material used to make the pillow cases. If you are sensitive to allergens, you might want to look elsewhere for a pillow case. I have ordered other pillow cases from Amazon and never had a problem."

And I kept hoping it would surprise me, instead of repeating all of the various stories to get to the ending that I knew was coming. It feels very much written to be a movie. I wondered what english actors would be the characters.I think the author is very gifted, but would have loved to be surprised."

I have always gravitated toward slice of life, choices-matter type video games and books but this one caught my attention right away and kept it until the end. I started it as a sample and when the sample ended, I simply had to keep going. I loved the tone of voice the author had and it was easy to read and root for the main character in all of her adventures. It was a powerful read that makes you think about your own life and how to appreciate what you have. Just a really good book."

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but it was not an easy read.The writing was good, clear, and crisp, but the subject matter was tough. The main character wasn't very likable for the majority of the text, but neither were most of the other characters in the book at some point. Yet, I never disliked her. She just didn't seem like someone I'd want to spend a lot of time with if I knew her in the real world. By the end, I'm still not sure about that, but I'd definitely make a point to say hi to her.The multiverse/reincarnation theme throughout the story was handled in a clever and sophisticated way. There were times when I thought I'd get bored with the back and forth but I never did. The author did a good job and knowing when to pull the reader away from the theme and focus on the character and vice versa.I don't think this is something I could recommend to just anyone. I'd have to know the person well enough to give them a proper trigger warning or at least know them well enough to gauge whether this would help or harm them in their present state.With that said, I wish I could recommend this book to everyone. It's really good. And if you've ever dealt with regret, this book may be just what you need.Highly recommended to those unafraid to explore the hardest and most basic aspect of the human condition or fans of multiverse concepts."

					"bookDescription": "A #1 bestseller on The New York Times, USA Today, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times!. From the celebrated author of The Nightingale and The Four Winds comes Kristin Hannah's The Women―at once an intimate portrait of coming of age in a dangerous time and an epic tale of a nation divided.Women can be heroes. When twenty-year-old nursing student Frances “Frankie” McGrath hears these words, it is a revelation. Raised in the sun-drenched, idyllic world of Southern California and sheltered by her conservative parents, she has always prided herself on doing the right thing. But in 1965, the world is changing, and she suddenly dares to imagine a different future for herself. When her brother ships out to serve in Vietnam, she joins the Army Nurse Corps and follows his path.. As green and inexperienced as the men sent to Vietnam to fight, Frankie is over-whelmed by the chaos and destruction of war. Each day is a gamble of life and death, hope and betrayal; friendships run deep and can be shattered in an instant. In war, she meets―and becomes one of―the lucky, the brave, the broken, and the lost.. But war is just the beginning for Frankie and her veteran friends. The real battle lies in coming home to a changed and divided America, to angry protesters, and to a country that wants to forget Vietnam. . The Women is the story of one woman gone to war, but it shines a light on all women who put themselves in harm’s way and whose sacrifice and commitment to their country has too often been forgotten. A novel about deep friendships and bold patriotism, The Women is a richly drawn story with a memorable heroine whose idealism and courage under fire will come to define an era.",

It's also an always welcome reminder of the importance of nurses in our lives and what happens when heroines face pre-judgment on the basis of gender.It's also a poorly written book that tries to cram everything about Vietnam into a single person's experience and ends up feeling as if Hannah was working off of a checklist.And then there are those adjectives -- the book is stuffed with them. Nine in the first two sentences alone. Descriptions of everything, including things that aren't important to the plot. Vietnam isn't just lush green, it's verdant green (which is pretty redundant). We get descriptions of what people are wearing and how they are wearing their hair in every scene. Hey, gotta remind people constantly that it's the '60s.But a description of a hospital in San Diego? Why? It's not important. We all know what a stateside hospital looks like. Everything is described down to the tiniest details while plot is often revealed in expository summaries. Every twist is telegraphed. But fashionable!OKAY, MINOR SPOILER COMINGI got to the end of the section on Vietnam and then there was a bunch of boring stuff about Frankie's return stateside. She rode off into the sunset and I was happy the book had finally ended. I turned the page to read the author's bio and was greeted with \"Part Two.\"Go into this knowing the book is long. It's not well-written. The story is okay and there are even some parts that will make you cry. Read it if you are interested in the subject matter and don't already know that much about. You will come out educated and proud of our military.If you already know about Vietnam, you can easily skip this and not miss anything. Except a lot of adjectives."

					"bookDescription": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the acclaimed author of The Longest Ride and The Notebook comes an emotional, powerful novel about wondering if we can change—or even make our peace with—the path we’ve taken.. “Sparks is superb at what he does. The setting is postcard perfect. The characters are immensely likable. . . . This is a tidy miracle you can count on.”—The Washington Post. Tanner Hughes was raised by his grandparents, following in his grandfather’s military footsteps to become an Army Ranger. His whole life has been spent abroad, and he is the proverbial rolling stone: happiest when off on his next adventure, zero desire to settle down.  But when his grandmother passes away, her last words to him are find where you belong. She also drops a bombshell, telling him the name of the father he never knew—and where to find him.. Tanner is due at his next posting soon, but his curiosity is piqued, and he sets out for Asheboro, North Carolina, to ask around. He’s been in town less than twenty-four hours when he meets Kaitlyn Cooper, a doctor and single mom. They both feel an immediate connection; Tanner knows Kaitlyn has a story to tell, and he wants to hear it. To Kaitlyn, Tanner is mysterious, exciting—and possibly leaving in just a few weeks.. Meanwhile, nearby, eighty-three-year-old Jasper lives alone in a cabin bordering a national forest. With only his old dog, Arlo, for company, he lives quietly, haunted by a tragic accident that took place decades before. When he hears rumors that a white deer has been spotted in the forest—a creature of legend that inspired his father and grandfather—he becomes obsessed with protecting the deer from poachers.. As these characters’ fates orbit closer together, none of them is expecting a miracle . . . but that may be exactly what is about to alter their futures forever.",

The killer left no clues. There were no witnesses, no one with a motive. But the police soon came to suspect Quincy Miller, a young Black man who was once a client of Russo’s. Quincy was tried, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison, maintaining his innocence. But no one was listening. He had no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. In desperation, he writes a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small nonprofit run by Cullen Post, a lawyer who is also an Episcopal minister. Guardian accepts only a few innocence cases at a time. Cullen Post travels the country fighting wrongful convictions and taking on clients forgotten by the system. With Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy Miller exonerated. They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another without a second thought. Don’t miss John Grisham’s new book, THE EXCHANGE: AFTER THE FIRM, coming soon!",

I put the raw kernels into a little bowl and added half teaspoon of oil, followed by a quarter teaspoon of Flavacol Popcorn salt. Mix it thoroughly, then added it to the bottom of the popper.  In both cases, all but three kernals popped So that was good.  Unfortunately, the same thing happened with the second and third popping as did with the first one. The popcorn kernels were small and some cases a little bit on the burnt side, but just a little.  I popped another batch in my sauce pot and the kernels came out huge and puffy like they always did.  Too late to return the glass popper so I'm going to keep it, but I probably won't use it."

					"bookDescription": "The New York Times bestseller—for fans of All the Light We Cannot See and The Tattooist of Auschwitz!. From the bestselling author of Truths I Never Told You, Before I Let You Go, and the The Warsaw Orphan, Kelly Rimmer’s powerful WWII novel follows a woman’s urgent search for answers to a family mystery that uncovers truths about herself that she never expected.. “Fans of The Nightingale and Lilac Girls will adore The Things We Cannot Say.” —Pam Jenoff, New York Times bestselling author. In 1942, Europe remains in the relentless grip of war. Just beyond the tents of the refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It’s a decision that will alter her destiny…and it’s a lie that will remain buried until the next century.. Since she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now fifteen and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina’s tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate.. Then, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents’ farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief.. Slipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative. The Things We Cannot Say is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced…and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.. Don’t miss Kelly Rimmer’s newest novel, The Paris Agent, where a family’s innocent search for answers brings a long-forgotten, twenty-five-year-old mystery featuring two female SOE operatives comes to light!

Ellie Mack was the perfect daughter. She was fifteen, the youngest of three. Beloved by her parents, friends, and teachers, and half of a teenaged golden couple. Ellie was days away from an idyllic post-exams summer vacation, with her whole life ahead of her. And then she was gone. Now, her mother Laurel Mack is trying to put her life back together. It’s been ten years since her daughter disappeared, seven years since her marriage ended, and only months since the last clue in Ellie’s case was unearthed. So when she meets an unexpectedly charming man in a café, no one is more surprised than Laurel at how quickly their flirtation develops into something deeper. Before she knows it, she’s meeting Floyd’s daughters—and his youngest, Poppy, takes Laurel’s breath away. Because looking at Poppy is like looking at Ellie. And now, the unanswered questions she’s tried so hard to put to rest begin to haunt Laurel anew. Where did Ellie go? Did she really run away from home, as the police have long suspected, or was there a more sinister reason for her disappearance? Who is Floyd, really? And why does his daughter remind Laurel so viscerally of her own missing girl?",

Lisa’s writing is clever, witty, and kept me engaged throughout the entire book.The missing persons trope is not new to psychological thrillers. I found many aspects of the book predictable. However, the way in which the story was told kept my interest. The story had multiple POV’s and time jumps but it was still easy to follow and navigate.Overall the characters are well flesh out. Lisa is a fantastic writer. She was able to make a story that being told before in the triller genre feel unique."

I was excited to get it & read it, but it wasn’t the good book I’d thought it be. It felt disorganized to me. Ellie disappears yet not until around pg 160 do we get any further info of her. The letter Noelle writes to Floyd is read to us without knowing how. The letter appears in Floyd’s mail bile but no content is revealed till later. Later we’re reading it, without any further explanation. So we can only imagine Floyd read it after. We can also only imagine Laurel will as well.

Then the coincidences begin – or everyone knows except Laurel. She meets Floyd in a cafe, whose youngest daughter, Poppy, looks like Ellie, etc. etc. How many family members or otherwise look exactly like another? Hardly ever!Captive and abduction stories are the very types of crime novels I don’t enjoy; I would have given “Then She Was Gone” a miss if I’d known.This one was, for me, unenjoyable and unbelievable, and it wasn’t page-turning. It was predictable as soon as Poppy made her entry. I love crime and mystery novels, but this one beggared belief. The scenes involving the characters were often cruel and gratuitous. Not a pleasurable read."

It is ten years after Ellie disappeared that Laurel meets a stranger at a café who brings romance back into her life. But when the man introduces Laurel to his daughter, something seems familiar… but very wrong.I really enjoyed this one. It has lots of twists and turns as well as unique characters. Sure, there were some times when the story was a little slow, but the fast-paced curveballs really make up for it. Lisa Jewell really kept me guessing nearly the whole time with this one. I really loved the dynamics of the characters and the complex emotions. Many thriller and mystery writers are quick to skip over the ins and outs of the characters in order to get to the twists and turns, but this book does an excellent job of slowing down in the right ways to let the reader build connections. It makes the tense moments and reveals feel much more personal. Overall, a solid book that I would definitely recommend."

One of Barack Obama's Favorite Books of 2023. “Brave and nuanced . . . an act of tremendous compassion and a literary triumph.” —The New York Times. “Immensely emotional and unforgettably haunting.” —The Wall Street JournalAcclaimed author Jonathan Rosen’s haunting investigation of the forces that led his closest childhood friend, Michael Laudor, from the heights of brilliant promise to the forensic psychiatric hospital where he has lived since killing the woman he loved. A story about friendship, love, and the price of self-delusion, The Best Minds explores the ways in which we understand—and fail to understand—mental illness.. When the Rosens moved to New Rochelle in 1973, Jonathan Rosen and Michael Laudor became inseparable. Both children of college professors, the boys were best friends and keen competitors, and, when they both got into Yale University, seemed set to join the American meritocratic elite.   Michael blazed through college in three years, graduating summa cum laude and landing a top-flight consulting job. But all wasn’t as it seemed. One day, Jonathan received the call: Michael had suffered a serious psychotic break and was in the locked ward of a psychiatric hospital.   Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, Michael was still battling delu\u00adsions when he traded his halfway house for Yale Law School. Featured in The New York Times as a role model genius, he sold a memoir, with film rights to Ron Howard. But then Michael, in the grip of an unshakeable paranoid fantasy, stabbed his girlfriend Carrie to death and became a front-page story of an entirely different sort.   Tender, funny, and harrowing by turns, The Best Minds is Jonathan Rosen’s magnificent and heartbreaking account of good intentions and tragic outcomes whose significance will echo widely.",

The book is actually a memoir of the author's life, which was unexceptional in almost every way. He had a very typical middle-class upbringing in an affluent suburb and had some good things happen to him, and some bad things happen to him, none of which are exceptionally notable. I got about halfway through the book and started skimming and figured out - this is honestly and truly not going anywhere, so I quit.This is the second book I have read recently that was described as being about an interesting topic, and ended up being the boring memoir of a completely unexceptional person. Is this some new trick that publishers are using to sell books - buying people's memoirs (hopefully cheap!) and then billing them as something more interesting/exciting than they actually are, just to get people to buy books? I have no idea why people thought this dry, overly-detailed recounting of someone's childhood experiences was interesting, unless maybe they're also boomers who think that the times they lived through need yet another recounting by someone who had no real involvement with the events of the era. I would skip this one - meandering and pointless."

I should have listened more to the reviews, rather than go off of the fact that I typically like Mel's information. Nearly the entire content is interviews with individuals to go over their issues. The issues aren't that insightful and they are rehashed several times over to boot. If you like hearing people cry and get all emotional about child hood issues then this is for you. I didn't relate well to it at all, but I'm more of a suck it up and move on personality type. Mel is typically more like that so this content kind of surprised me, but it was from years ago too. I am all for being empathetic, but she's not a counselor and I don't want to be a part of others private counseling sessions. That's probably the best way to sum up the entire book, you are a witness to others counseling sessions. No thanks."

You don't try to go back trying to fix your past but you do need to recognize it is still a part of who you are today. I have gained much truth, freedom and insight from this book. I recommend it for anyone who experiences anxieties (you may not even know that you do). If you feel like you just want to start trying to be whoever-in-this-hell-of-a-life that you are supposed to be, then read this book and... start to take control.I used the audible book, ordered a set of soft cushioned earphones and made time for me. What a treat! It's not the kind of book that has to be over once the final credits are read. I am now willing to get better and live the life that's meant for me to the best of my ability...  I am so thankful for Mel. I never knew of her until I saw this book on Amazon in my search for self-help. Thank you, lady, you've done an awesome work!!!"

A New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Publishers Weekly Bestseller. “Poignant, engrossing.”—People • “Lisa Wingate takes an almost unthinkable chapter in our nation’s history and weaves a tale of enduring power.”—Paula McLainMemphis, 1939. Twelve-year-old Rill Foss and her four younger siblings live a magical life aboard their family’s Mississippi River shantyboat. But when their father must rush their mother to the hospital one stormy night, Rill is left in charge—until strangers arrive in force. Wrenched from all that is familiar and thrown into a Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage, the Foss children are assured that they will soon be returned to their parents—but they quickly realize the dark truth. At the mercy of the facility’s cruel director, Rill fights to keep her sisters and brother together in a world of danger and uncertainty.. Aiken, South Carolina, present day. Born into wealth and privilege, Avery Stafford seems to have it all: a successful career as a federal prosecutor, a handsome fiancé, and a lavish wedding on the horizon. But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family’s long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption.. Based on one of America’s most notorious real-life scandals—in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country—Lisa Wingate’s riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong.. Publishers Weekly’s #3 Longest-Running Bestseller of 2017 • Winner of the Southern Book Prize • If All Arkansas Read the Same Book Selection. This edition includes a new essay by the author about shantyboat life.",

One part deals with Rill Foss, a 12-year-old girl living in a shantyboat along the Mississippi River with her four younger siblings. They run afoul the Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage in Menphis. The second part deal with Avery Stafford, a lawyer from a prominent South Carolina family. How these two stories come together is creative and compelling. They both deal with the true-life scandal involving the Tennessee Children’s Home Society. If this had simply been a work of fiction, many readers would have assumed such things could not really happen. But they did and the fact that legalized kidnapping occurred is well documented in this work of historical fiction. The author has done a wonderful job of combining believable characters with this historic tragedy to produce a remarkable novel. I must admit the portion of the novel based in South Carolina is not as compelling but serves to bring these victims into the current day and thus important to the story. This is one novel you will remember for a long, long time."

Putting it in the dryer with a wet towel to get the wrinkles out would have probably made it worse because the sleeves and ties would have bound it up in a ball and made the dress worse.

					"bookDescription": "The #1 New York Times bestseller. Over 20 million copies sold!. Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results. No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.. If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.. Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.. Learn how to: make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;design your environment to make success easier;get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.. Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.",

					"bookDescription": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER 6 MILLION COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE! Now with exclusive new content from the paperback edition, the life-changing memoir that has inspired millions of listeners through the Academy Award-winning actor’s unflinching honesty, unconventional wisdom, and lessons learned the hard way about living with greater satisfaction. “The No. 1 celebrity memoir of the past 10 years.”—USA Today “McConaughey’s book invites us to grapple with the lessons of his life as he did—and to see that the point was never to win, but to understand.”—Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck I’ve been in this life for fifty years, been trying to work out its riddle for forty-two, and been keeping diaries of clues to that riddle for the last thirty-five. Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me. Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges—how to get relative with the inevitable—you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.” So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops. Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears. It’s a love letter. To life. It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights—and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too. Good luck.",

					"bookDescription": "WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR FICTION. ONE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES’S 100 BEST BOOKS OF THE 21ST CENTURY . A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVORITE BOOKS OF 2022LONGLISTED FOR THE 2022 BOOKER PRIZE. “Buzzy and enthralling . . . A glorious novel about empires and erasures, husbands and wives, staggering fortunes and unspeakable misery . . . Fun as hell to read.” —Oprah Daily. \"A genre-bending, time-skipping story about New York City’s elite in the roaring ’20s and Great Depression.\" —Vanity Fair. “A riveting story of class, capitalism, and greed.” —Esquire. \"Exhilarating.” —New York Times. Even through the roar and effervescence of the 1920s, everyone in New York has heard of Benjamin and Helen Rask. He is a legendary Wall Street tycoon; she is the daughter of eccentric aristocrats. Together, they have risen to the very top of a world of seemingly endless wealth—all as a decade of excess and speculation draws to an end. But at what cost have they acquired their immense fortune? This is the mystery at the center of Bonds, a successful 1937 novel that all of New York seems to have read. Yet there are other versions of this tale of privilege and deceit.    Hernan Diaz’s TRUST elegantly puts these competing narratives into conversation with one another—and in tension with the perspective of one woman bent on disentangling fact from fiction. The result is a novel that spans over a century and becomes more exhilarating with each new revelation.    At once an immersive story and a brilliant literary puzzle, TRUST engages the reader in a quest for the truth while confronting the deceptions that often live at the heart of personal relationships, the reality-warping force of capital, and the ease with which power can manipulate facts.",

Unlike some others in that category, I found it very approachable, and while slightly unusual, not terribly so.The book consists of four, very different, though interconnected sections.  The first is a putative work of fiction, focused on a Wall Street robber baron and his mentally challenged wife.  The second is the partially completed memoirs of the financier upon whose life the work of fiction was based.  The third focuses on the young lady who is tasked with ghost writing the memoir, whose primary charge is on the rehabilitation of the mentally unstable wife.  Finally, we are presented the journal entries of the wife herself.I enjoyed the book, though the final section really doesn’t bring much to the table.  It is a solid piece of work, with good writing and interesting characters."

					"bookDescription": "Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the number-one New York Times best seller Outliers, reinvents the audiobook in this immersive production of Talking to Strangers, a powerful examination of our interactions with people we don’t know. How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true? While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you’ll hear the voices of people he interviewed - scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There’s even a theme song - Janelle Monae’s “Hell You Talmbout”. Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. The audiobook edition of Talking to Strangers was an instant number-one best seller, and was one of the most pre-ordered audiobooks in history. It seamlessly marries audiobooks and podcasts, creating a completely new and real listening experience.",

The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force tactical air controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him the Fittest (Real) Man in America.In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40 percent of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.An annotated edition of Can't Hurt Me, offering over two hours of bonus content featuring deeper insights and never-before-told stories shared by David.

I am still reading the book and I have been notating the challenges. The reviews saying there is too much cussing. Has never been around hardcore military people before and it shows. The writing was fine to me since we get to see it through his eyes. I do agree motivation is a loaf of crap. You just have to do it and get it done.

If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.. On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven addressed the graduating class of the University of Texas at Austin on their Commencement day. Taking inspiration from the university's slogan, \"What starts here changes the world,\" he shared the ten principles he learned during Navy Seal training that helped him overcome challenges not only in his training and long Naval career, but also throughout his life; and he explained how anyone can use these basic lessons to change themselves-and the world-for the better.. Admiral McRaven's original speech went viral with over 10 million views. Building on the core tenets laid out in his speech, McRaven now recounts tales from his own life and from those of people he encountered during his military service who dealt with hardship and made tough decisions with determination, compassion, honor, and courage. Told with great humility and optimism, this timeless book provides simple wisdom, practical advice, and words of encouragement that will inspire readers to achieve more, even in life's darkest moments. \"Powerful.\" --USA Today. \"Full of captivating personal anecdotes from inside the national security vault.\" --Washington Post. \"Superb, smart, and succinct.\" --Forbes",

					"bookDescription": "\"Draws readers in from the first heart-stopping pages and doesn't let go until the end.\" – Mary Kubica, New York Times bestselling author of Local Woman Missing. The bestselling author of Twenty Years Later and master of modern suspense is back with a brilliantly twisting, skillfully plotted thriller perfect for fans of Jeneva Rose and Colleen Hoover’s Verity.. Alex Armstrong has changed everything about herself—her name, her appearance, her backstory. She’s no longer the terrified teenager a rapt audience saw on television, emerging in handcuffs from the quiet suburban home the night her family was massacred. That girl, Alexandra Quinlan, nicknamed Empty Eyes by the media, was accused of the killings, fought to clear her name, and later took the stand during her highly publicized defamation lawsuit that captured the attention of the nation.. It’s been ten years since, and Alex hasn’t stopped searching for answers about the night her family was killed, even as she continues to hide her real identity from true crime fanatics and grasping reporters still desperate to locate her. As a legal investigator, she works tirelessly to secure justice for others, too. People like Matthew Claymore, who’s under suspicion in the disappearance of his girlfriend, a student journalist named Laura McAllister.. Laura was about to break a major story about rape and cover-ups on her college campus. Alex believes Matthew is innocent, and unearths stunning revelations about the university’s faculty, fraternity members, and powerful parents willing to do anything to protect their children.. Most shocking of all—as Alex digs into Laura’s disappearance, she realizes there are unexpected connections to the murder of her own family. For as different as the crimes may seem, they each hinge on one sinister truth: no one is quite who they seem to be . . .. “Engrossing…not to be missed.” –Publishers Weekly STARRED REVIEW",

					"bookDescription": "“You can’t prepare yourself for the magnitude and emotional impact of this powerful novel.” —John Irving. From the New York Times bestselling author John Boyne, a stunning tour de force about a woman who must confront the sins of her own terrible past, and a present in which it is never too late for bravery. Ninety-one-year-old Gretel Fernsby has lived in the same well-to-do mansion block in London for decades. She lives a quiet, comfortable life, despite her deeply disturbing, dark past. She doesn’t talk about her escape from Nazi Germany at age twelve. She doesn’t talk about the grim postwar years in France with her mother. Most of all, she doesn’t talk about her father, who was the commandant of one of the Reich’s most notorious extermination camps.. Then, a new family moves into the apartment below her. In spite of herself, Gretel can’t help but begin a friendship with the little boy, Henry, though his presence brings back memories she would rather forget. One night, she witnesses a disturbing, violent argument between Henry’s beautiful mother and his arrogant father, one that threatens Gretel’s hard-won, self-contained existence.. Immersive, chilling, unputdownable, All the Broken Places moves back and forth in time between Gretel’s girlhood in Germany and present-day London. Here, Gretel is at a similar crossroads to the one she encountered long ago. Then, she denied her own complicity, but now, faced with a chance to interrogate her guilt, grief, and remorse, she can choose to save a young boy. If she does, she will be forced to reveal the secrets she has spent a lifetime protecting. This time, she can make a different choice than before—whatever the cost to herself.",

					"bookDescription": "AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. LAPD Detective Renée Ballard tracks a serial rapist whose trail has gone cold, and enlists a new volunteer to the Open-Unsolved Unit: patrol officer Maddie Bosch, Harry’s daughter.. Renée Ballard and the LAPD’s Open-Unsolved Unit get a hot shot DNA connection between a recently arrested man and a serial rapist and murderer who went quiet two decades ago. The arrested man is only twenty-four, so the genetic link must be familial: His father was the Pillowcase Rapist, responsible for a five-year reign of terror in the City of Angels. But when Ballard and her team move in on their suspect, they encounter a baffling web of secrets and legal hurdles.. Meanwhile, Ballard’s badge, gun, and ID are stolen—a theft she can’t report without giving her enemies in the department ammunition to end her career as a detective. She works the burglary alone, but her mission draws her into unexpected danger. With no choice but to go outside the department for help, she knocks on the door of Harry Bosch.. At the same time, Ballard takes on a new volunteer to the cold case unit: Bosch’s daughter Maddie, now a patrol officer. But Maddie has an ulterior motive for getting access to the city’s library of lost souls—a case that may be the most iconic in the city’s history. Complex, satisfying, and full of dexterous twists, The Waiting demonstrates once more that “you can’t do better than Michael Connelly” (Forbes).",

								"body": "I'm pretty sure I've read everything of Michael's.The book is 'good', it's just not 'great'.As a huge fan it is always comforting for me to read one of his books, but after 3 decades he's not quite what he used to be and frankly neither am I.I've been spoiled by such great stuff that it's impossible to continue to expect him to outdo himself every time.I didn't get choked up the way I usually do at certain points, Maddie was never in danger, Ballard neither.Harry had a very limited role.And while a few storylines are woven together it just didn't really compel me the way a great work optimally should.I will continue to read everything Michael offers. And I love the Bosch TV series, and The Lincoln lawyer TV series.But like a lot of great authors I feel like Michael's first 5 or 10 books were by far his very best.The books where we got to really know Harry Bosch, where his biography unfolds, or who se childhood scars were revealed, where he evolved through his early and middle years on the police force as a detective.I don't see how one continues to be driven to new heights and to pull out the very best, every time.Meanwhile a 4 star Michael Connelly book is still enjoyable and thoughtful and it's crafted by a very special artist who still has a beautiful style."

								"body": "I am a firm believer that good writing is an artistic achievement. Not all writers ever rise to the level of \"\" art\"\"  but this story and this writer have risen to that top bar.This was an excellent story with an outstanding hook.  It was wrote to be read quickly and not a lot of useless information for the reader to suffer under.  Which I appreciate more than I can say.  Its a great , easy to read book about the cold case of Elizabeth Short crime saga. Ballard, the lead detective in a cold case unit of primarily volentier staff uncover long hidden pictures of the Short murder which prove who her murderer to br. Politics between departments cause the case to be held up some what.The Elizabeth Short murder may be!the most notable unsolved murder in America since the 1900s.The Bosh series have several books that ring that bell of greatness , this is the first Ballard book that climbs that ladder of achievement.I am a long tenured fan of Mr. Connelly and the Harry Bosh series therefore I  am glad to see the on going of this series and the high level of work that is given to it."

								"body": "The Waiting by Michael Connelly is a masterful exploration of suspense and human resilience. Known for his gripping crime stories, Connelly delves into a more intimate narrative here, weaving a tale that is both emotionally charged and filled with quiet tension. The story follows a protagonist waiting for an uncertain outcome, drawing readers into their inner turmoil and the slow unraveling of buried truths.Connelly’s prose is as sharp as ever, building an atmosphere of quiet dread while offering moments of profound introspection. While the pacing may feel slower compared to his usual high-octane thrillers, this shift allows for a deeper dive into character development and psychological nuance. Fans of Connelly’s work will appreciate his ability to step into a different narrative style without losing the trademark intensity of his storytelling.A compelling read for those who enjoy psychological dramas with a touch of mystery."
